# Autopilot State: Clem Feedback E2E

## Exit Condition

- Re-audited planning and doing docs converge through every Work Planner reviewer gate.
- Work Doer completes all TDD units with 100% new-code coverage and zero warnings.
- Changed UI passes visual QA on desktop and mobile.
- QA deploy, cross-device smoke, purge, and residue inspection pass before merge.
- A reviewed PR merges with green CI.
- The exact merge SHA's automatic production deploy passes readiness, web/API/cross-device smoke, and cleanup.
- Desk/git/worktree state is terminal and clean; the post-completion Slugger handoff is attempted and any failure reported.

## Current Item

- Repository: `/Users/arimendelow/Projects/spoonjoy-v2-clem-feedback`
- Branch: `worker/clem-feedback-e2e`; the previous pushed checkpoint is `cfb7c71f`. Local docs contain Ambiguity Round 16's fixes for the fresh reviewer's 2 blockers, 8 majors, and 1 minor.
- Planning: `../2026-07-14-1313-planning-clem-feedback-e2e.md` is approved after five fresh hostile rounds.
- Doing: `../2026-07-14-1313-doing-clem-feedback-e2e.md` is `drafting`; implementation has not started.
- Active gate: commit/push and synchronize the Round 16 checkpoint, then run a different fresh context-independent Ambiguity reviewer. After Ambiguity is clean, complete Quality and alternating Scrutiny until one clean Tinfoil pass and one immediately consecutive clean Stranger pass.
- No PR, QA deploy, merge, or production deploy exists yet.

## Next Action

Commit/push this Ambiguity Round 16 checkpoint and its synchronized Desk copy, run a different fresh Ambiguity reviewer, fix and re-review until clean, then continue through Quality and alternating Scrutiny until two consecutive scrutiny passes converge.

## Operator-Locked Rules

- Authenticated live cook state is Durable Object-canonical; D1 is private projection/history only.
- Anonymous cook state remains local-only; authenticated local cache/queue is non-canonical.
- No first-party import UI, AI tag-suggestion surface, Pebble-specific behavior, automatic RecipeSpoon creation, or broad navigation redesign.
- SavedRecipe is private and separate from cookbooks; accepted manual tags ship before any AI proposal model.
- Use strict TDD, 100% new-code coverage, zero warnings, atomic commits/pushes, harsh reviewer gates, QA-before-merge, and exact-SHA production verification.
- Stop only for a true human-only credential/capability blocker or an unsafe destructive production action with no staged path.

## Terminal Evidence

- Not terminal. No implementation, CI, deploy, merge, smoke, or cleanup claim has been made.

## Continuation Scan

| candidate | classification | evidence | disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planning reviewer gate | deferred by scope | Planning approved at `2c3b4759` after convergence | Closed |
| Doing review chain | needs reviewer gate | Granularity and Validation converged; Round 16 fixes all 11 findings from fresh Ambiguity review locally | Commit/sync, re-review Ambiguity with a different fresh agent, then Quality and alternating Scrutiny |
| Work Doer Units 0-37 | ready | Full red/green/verify/visual/ship queue is defined | Start after doing review convergence |
| PR/QA/merge/production | ready | Units 32-37 define exact-SHA delivery path | Execute after implementation/local validation |

## Recovery Instructions

1. Read this file, the feedback source, planning doc, and doing doc.
2. Run `git status --short --branch` and `git log -5 --oneline` in the worktree.
3. Run `gh pr list --repo spoonjoy/spoonjoy-v2 --state open` and inspect current CI/deploy state.
4. Resume the first non-terminal unit or reviewer gate; update this file after every meaningful checkpoint.

## Stop Condition

Not satisfied. Ready work and reviewer gates remain.
