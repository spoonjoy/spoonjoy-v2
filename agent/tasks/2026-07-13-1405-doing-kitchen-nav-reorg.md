# Doing: Kitchen Navigation Reorg

**Status**: drafting
**Execution Mode**: direct
**Created**: 2026-07-13 14:22
**Planning**: ./2026-07-13-1405-planning-kitchen-nav-reorg.md
**Artifacts**: ./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/

## Execution Mode

- **pending**: Awaiting user approval before each unit starts only when the user explicitly requested interactive per-unit approval; otherwise convert this to `spawn` or `direct` unless a hard exception is present
- **spawn**: Spawn sub-agent for each unit (parallel/autonomous)
- **direct**: Execute units sequentially in current session (default)

## Objective
Make Spoonjoy's primary organization obvious across the web app and Apple native app: a signed-in cook can quickly find their own recipes, saved recipes, cookbooks, shopping list, fellow chefs, and global search without decoding the current mixed kitchen/index language.

## Upstream Work Items
- None

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] Signed-in web desktop navigation exposes exact labels/routes: `Kitchen` -> `/`, `My Recipes` -> `/my-recipes`, `Saved` or `Saved Recipes` -> `/saved-recipes`, `Cookbooks` -> `/cookbooks`, `Shopping List` -> `/shopping-list`, `Chefs` -> `/chefs`, and `Kitchen Search` -> `/search`.
- [ ] Web keeps `/recipes` as `Explore Recipes` / broader all-recipes browsing and does not reuse that label for the current user's authored recipes.
- [ ] Web My Recipes at `/my-recipes` shows recipes authored by the current user through `Recipe.chefId`, supports a local search/filter query, and provides a create-recipe action.
- [ ] Web Saved Recipes at `/saved-recipes` shows deduped recipes saved through cookbooks owned by the current user through `RecipeInCookbook` plus `Cookbook.authorId`, including the user's own recipes when saved in a cookbook, and supports a local search/filter query.
- [ ] Web Cookbooks at `/cookbooks` is a real owned-cookbooks surface based on `Cookbook.authorId`, supports a local search/filter query, and no longer redirects authenticated users to `/?tab=cookbooks`.
- [ ] Web Chefs at `/chefs` includes existing fellow-chef semantics from `app/lib/fellow-chefs.server.ts`, a "Chefs Using My Recipes" section, and a private chronological activity section that excludes shopping-list events.
- [ ] Web global search remains at `/search` with existing scopes `all`, `recipes`, `cookbooks`, `chefs`, and `shopping-list`; personal drawer search/filter inputs do not create a second global-search semantics.
- [ ] Web "Latest from the kitchen" copy is replaced with `On the Counter`, with deterministic selection from the current display recipe ordering and no false freshness claim.
- [ ] Web mobile navigation labels use kitchen terms (`My Kitchen`, `My Recipes`, `Saved`, `Cookbooks`, `Shopping List`, `Chefs`, `Search`) and the dock is visually glass/material-like while preserving fixed bottom safe-area behavior at 320-390px and desktop-hidden behavior at `lg`.
- [ ] Native compact iPhone `TabView` exposes exactly five tabs: `Kitchen`, `My Recipes`, `Saved`, `Cookbooks`, and `Shopping List`; `Search` is removed as a bottom tab and remains reachable from the trailing toolbar menu item labeled `Search`, which opens the `.search(query:scope:)` route where `.searchable` uses toolbar-principal placement and search scopes.
- [ ] Native regular-width `NavigationSplitView` sidebar exposes `Kitchen`, `My Recipes`, `Saved Recipes`, `Cookbooks`, `Shopping List`, `Chefs`, `Kitchen Search`, `Imports`, and `Settings`.
- [ ] Native route model includes a first-class `chefs` section/route or an explicit `chefs` route alias to chef search/profile graph, and the sidebar Chefs destination is tested.
- [ ] Native My Recipes filters cached/displayed recipes to the current authenticated chef when `currentChefID` is known, uses a snapshot/current-chef repository rather than the public live catalog for the personal drawer, and signed-out or unavailable-current-chef fallback stays safe and non-crashing.
- [ ] Native Saved Recipes uses the same saved-through-cookbooks definition as web by deduping `contentState.cookbooks.flatMap(\\.recipes)` by recipe ID.
- [ ] Native toolbar Search renders `SearchView` as an auxiliary compact route after removing the Search bottom tab, and route/section mapping tests prove `.search` no longer depends on a removed tab item.
- [ ] Native tab bar/mobile navigation uses system material/translucent chrome (`UITabBarAppearance`/SwiftUI toolbar material) instead of the current opaque bone treatment, with tests proving translucency/material setup.
- [ ] Web `docs/design-language.md` and native `docs/native-design-language.md` document the finalized drawer names, saved-recipes definition, search posture, and mobile navigation behavior.
- [ ] Native screenshot validation runs against the highest available bootable iPhone simulator resolved by `.github/scripts/resolve-ios-simulator-destination.py` or a pinned `SPOONJOY_IOS_SIMULATOR_NAME`/`SPOONJOY_IOS_SIMULATOR_UDID`, records the resolved simulator name/UDID in artifacts or blocker logs, and runs macOS validation against `generic/platform=macOS`.
- [ ] Native route-matrix validation covers exact routes `kitchen`, `recipes`, `saved-recipes`, `cookbooks`, `shopping-list`, and `search`; if the current screenshot harness lacks `saved-recipes`, this task adds that support before visual QA.
- [ ] Native `design-review.json` for successful captures is schema-valid under `scripts/validate-design-review.rb` and includes `mobileScreenshot`, `desktopScreenshot`, `dynamicType`, `voiceOverLabels`, `keyboardNavigation`, `reduceMotion`, `contrast`, `kitchenTableHierarchy`, `noOverlap`, `screenshotRoute`, route-specific signed-in proof fields, and iOS/macOS `accessibilityProofArtifacts`.
- [ ] Native app-emitted accessibility proof uses `SPOONJOY_SCREENSHOT_ACCESSIBILITY_PROOF_PATH` or `SIMCTL_CHILD_SPOONJOY_SCREENSHOT_ACCESSIBILITY_PROOF_PATH`, includes `emittedBy: SpoonjoyApp`, expected bundle identifiers, `minimumTargetSize`, `textFits`, `noTinyClusters`, observed Dynamic Type and Reduce Motion values, route-specific `routeEvidence`, and `offlineIndicatorProof`.
- [ ] Native `routeEvidence` names actual visible anchors for VoiceOver labels, keyboard navigation targets, Dynamic Type text styles, contrast pairs, hierarchy anchors, and layout guards for each changed route; route-agnostic boolean-only proof is not accepted.
- [ ] Native `offlineIndicatorProof` names `OfflineStatusView`, visible states `offline`, `stale`, `queuedWork`, `syncFailure`, `conflict`, `blocker`, `destructiveConfirmation`, dismissible states `offline` and `stale`, severe states `queuedWork`, `syncFailure`, `conflict`, `blocker`, `destructiveConfirmation`, hidden states `synced` and `dismissed`, VoiceOver label proof, `Hide offline status` dismiss button proof, and severity-correct mapping.
- [ ] Native screenshot blockers produce schema-valid `design-review-blocked.json` under `scripts/validate-design-review-blocker.rb` and do not leave a partial `design-review.json`.
- [ ] Web visual validation captures mobile and desktop evidence for the home, personal drawers, search access, and mobile dock; any absurdity ledger entries for this task are closed or explicitly blocked with evidence.
- [ ] No OAuth files or behavior are edited except incidental imports/tests required by navigation compilation.
- [ ] 100% test coverage on all new code
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No warnings
- [ ] If UI/rendering/layout changed: `visual-qa-dogfood` evidence captured, absurdity ledger closed, and automated visual metrics still pass

## Code Coverage Requirements
**MANDATORY: 100% coverage on all new code.**
- No `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]` or equivalent on new code
- All branches covered (if/else, switch, try/catch)
- All error paths tested
- Edge cases: null, empty, boundary values

## TDD Requirements
**Strict TDD — no exceptions:**
1. **Tests first**: Write failing tests BEFORE any implementation
2. **Verify failure**: Run tests, confirm they FAIL (red)
3. **Minimal implementation**: Write just enough code to pass
4. **Verify pass**: Run tests, confirm they PASS (green)
5. **Refactor**: Clean up, keep tests green
6. **No skipping**: Never write implementation without failing test first

### ⬜ Unit 3a: Native Route Model And Saved Recipes — Tests
**What**: Write failing Swift tests for `AppRoute.savedRecipes`, `AppSection.savedRecipes`, `AppRoute.chefs` or the chosen explicit chefs alias, state identifier round-trip, current-chef filtering for My Recipes, proof that My Recipes uses a snapshot/current-chef repository instead of `LiveRecipeCatalogRepository`, saved-recipes dedupe from `Cookbook.recipes`, and sidebar/compact tab source contracts.
**Output**: Failing Swift tests in `Tests/SpoonjoyCoreTests/AppStateTests.swift`, recipe-catalog/view-model tests, and/or native design contract tests; red logs saved under `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-3a/`.
**Acceptance**: Focused Swift tests fail red against the current native route model and tab/sidebar definitions.

### ⬜ Unit 3b: Native Route Model And Saved Recipes — Implementation
**What**: Update `Sources/SpoonjoyCore/AppState/AppRoute.swift` for `savedRecipes` and `chefs` or the chosen explicit chefs alias; add saved-recipes view model/surface code in `Sources/SpoonjoyCore/Features/RecipeCatalog`; add a current-chef-owned snapshot repository/view-model for My Recipes that does not call `PublicCatalogRequests.listRecipes`; add `Apps/Spoonjoy/Shared/Views/SavedRecipesView.swift`; register any new Swift view in both iOS and macOS sources in `Spoonjoy.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`; update `Apps/Spoonjoy/Shared/Views/RecipesView.swift` for "My Recipes" copy/filtering; wire destinations in `Apps/Spoonjoy/Shared/AppShell/PlatformNavigationView.swift`.

### ⬜ Unit 3c: Native Route Model And Saved Recipes — Coverage & Refactor
**What**: Cover empty saved-recipes, duplicate recipes across cookbooks, signed-out/current-chef-unavailable fallback, and route parsing rejection of unsafe identifiers.
**Output**: Additional Swift tests and coverage/focused-test logs under `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-3c/`.
**Acceptance**: Focused Swift coverage for new route/view-model code is complete and tests stay green with warnings as errors.

### ⬜ Unit 4a: Native Navigation And Liquid Glass — Tests
**What**: Update/add failing tests in `Tests/SpoonjoyCoreTests/NativeMobileDesignContractTests.swift`, `Tests/SpoonjoyCoreTests/KitchenRecipesStructureContractTests.swift`, and related source-contract tests for five compact tabs, regular sidebar labels including Chefs and Kitchen Search, `.search` mapping to a compact auxiliary route instead of a removed tab item, the trailing compact toolbar `Search` menu item opening `.search(query:scope:)`, search-route `.searchable(... placement: .toolbarPrincipal ...)`, `On the Counter`, and translucent/material tab bar appearance.
**Output**: Failing native source-contract tests and red logs under `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-4a/`.
**Acceptance**: Focused native design-contract tests fail red on current Search tab, opaque tab bar, old labels, and old editorial copy.

### ⬜ Unit 4b: Native Navigation And Liquid Glass — Implementation
**What**: Update compact `TabView` and sidebar in `PlatformNavigationView.swift`; remove `.search` from compact tab roots and make `.search` a compact auxiliary route rendered by `compactImmersiveRouteContent`/`destinationContent`; keep search available through the existing trailing toolbar `Menu` item labeled `Search`, whose action calls `performSearch(search)` and navigates to the `.search(query:scope:)` route; keep `.searchable(text:isPresented:placement:.toolbarPrincipal,prompt:"Search Spoonjoy")` and `.searchScopes` active only on the compact search route; wire Chefs sidebar to the `chefs` route/alias; update `Apps/Spoonjoy/iOS/SpoonjoyiOSApp.swift` to use translucent/material `UITabBarAppearance`; update native route titles and labels.
**Output**: Native navigation/chrome source changes and green focused native design-contract logs under `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-4b/`.
**Acceptance**: Unit 4a tests pass; bottom tabs are exactly Kitchen, My Recipes, Saved, Cookbooks, Shopping List; Search is reachable from toolbar/menu.

### ⬜ Unit 4c: Native Navigation And Liquid Glass — Coverage & Refactor
**What**: Run focused native tests for app state, navigation contracts, and design contracts; refactor duplication in title/label mapping only if tests show repeated fragile strings.
**Output**: Focused native test logs and any local refactor diff notes under `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-4c/`.
**Acceptance**: Focused native tests pass with warnings as errors and no route/tab source-contract holes.

### ⬜ Unit 5a: Web/Native Design Docs And Screenshot Contract — Tests
**What**: Write failing source-contract tests for web `docs/design-language.md`, native `docs/native-design-language.md`, and exact native screenshot route/proof support for `saved-recipes` in `scripts/capture-native-screenshots.sh`, `scripts/capture-native-screenshot-matrix.sh`, and `Apps/Spoonjoy/Shared/Components/ScreenshotAccessibilityProofWriter.swift`.
**Output**: Failing docs/harness source-contract tests and red logs under `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-5a/`.
**Acceptance**: Tests fail red until docs and harness/proof route anchors include the kitchen drawer model, saved-recipes definition, search posture, and mobile navigation behavior.

### ⬜ Unit 5b: Web/Native Design Docs And Screenshot Contract — Implementation
**What**: Update web/native design docs; update `scripts/capture-native-screenshots.sh`, `scripts/capture-native-screenshot-matrix.sh`, and `Apps/Spoonjoy/Shared/Components/ScreenshotAccessibilityProofWriter.swift` when Unit 5a red tests prove `saved-recipes` route/evidence support is missing.
**Output**: Documentation and screenshot/proof harness source changes plus green source-contract logs under `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-5b/`.

### ⬜ Unit 5c: Web/Native Design Docs And Screenshot Contract — Coverage & Refactor
**What**: Run native screenshot-contract tests and documentation source-contract tests; refactor proof route evidence tables only to keep route-specific anchors maintainable.
**Output**: Contract test logs and route-evidence refactor notes under `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-5c/`.
**Acceptance**: Contract tests pass and no route uses route-agnostic proof.

### ⬜ Unit 6a: Cross-Surface Validation — Capture
**What**: Run these exact validation commands and save each log: web `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run test:coverage`, `pnpm run build`, and `pnpm exec playwright test e2e/flows/spoondock-responsive.spec.ts`; native `swift test --disable-xctest --parallel -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors`, `swift test --enable-code-coverage --disable-xctest --parallel -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors`, `ruby scripts/enforce-swift-coverage.rb --coverage-json "$(swift test --show-codecov-path)" --minimum 100 --include 'Sources/SpoonjoyCore'`, `scripts/verify-native-scenarios.sh --stage final`, `xcodebuild test -project Spoonjoy.xcodeproj -scheme "Spoonjoy iOS" -configuration BootstrapDebug -destination "$(python3 .github/scripts/resolve-ios-simulator-destination.py)" CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO GCC_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=YES`, and `xcodebuild test -project Spoonjoy.xcodeproj -scheme "Spoonjoy macOS" -configuration BootstrapDebug -destination 'generic/platform=macOS' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO GCC_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=YES`.
**Output**: Raw validation logs, coverage paths, and any native blocker JSON paths under `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-6a/`.
**Acceptance**: Validation results are captured without making source changes in this unit; every failure is classified as implementation fix, test expectation fix, or true local capability blocker. A true local capability blocker requires exact command/output evidence, such as missing `pnpm`/Playwright browser install, failed `python3 .github/scripts/resolve-ios-simulator-destination.py`, missing `xcodebuild`, or Xcode/CoreSimulator platform failure; otherwise it is a fixable failure.

### ⬜ Unit 6b: Cross-Surface Validation — Targeted Fixes
**What**: Address failures classified in Unit 6a with the smallest targeted test/code/doc changes, preserving TDD for any behavior bug and avoiding new unrelated scope.
**Output**: Fix commits and focused rerun logs under `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-6b/`, or a note that no implementation/test fixes were needed.
**Acceptance**: Each Unit 6a non-capability failure has a corresponding fix and focused green rerun, or a documented reason it was reclassified as a capability blocker.

### ⬜ Unit 6c: Cross-Surface Validation — Final Rerun
**What**: Rerun the exact Unit 6a command list after targeted fixes, except commands already classified with true local capability blocker artifacts are not re-run unless the blocker was repaired.
**Output**: Final validation logs and coverage/blocker artifacts under `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-6c/`.
**Acceptance**: Required web/native validation passes with no warnings, except true local Xcode/simulator capability blockers are represented by schema-valid blocker artifacts.

### ⬜ Unit 6d: Cross-Surface Visual QA Dogfood
**What**: Start web dev server with `pnpm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1` on an available port and capture mobile `390x844` plus desktop `1440x1000` screenshots for `/`, `/my-recipes`, `/saved-recipes`, `/cookbooks`, `/chefs`, `/search`, and mobile dock states. Run native screenshot matrix with `SPOONJOY_SCREENSHOT_MATRIX_ROUTES=kitchen,recipes,saved-recipes,cookbooks,shopping-list,search scripts/capture-native-screenshot-matrix.sh --artifact-root ./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-6d/native --unit-slug kitchen-nav`.
**Output**: Web screenshots, native route-matrix JSON, native `design-review.json` or `design-review-blocked.json`, and absurdity ledger under `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-6d/`.
**Acceptance**: Web screenshots show no overlapping text or broken nav; native `design-review.json` or `design-review-blocked.json` artifacts validate; absurdity ledger for this task is closed or blocked with evidence.

### ⬜ Unit 6e: Final Git And Commit Hygiene
**What**: Review both worktrees for unrelated changes, verify no OAuth files were edited, commit any remaining logical changes atomically, and capture final `git status --short --branch` plus `git diff --stat`.
**Output**: Final git hygiene logs and commit list under `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-6e/`.
**Acceptance**: Both worktrees have only intended changes committed or explicitly documented; no unrelated/OAuth changes are included.

### ⬜ Unit 6f: Push, PR, And Available Deploy
**What**: In the web worktree run `git push -u origin agent/kitchen-nav-reorg`, `gh pr create --fill --base main --head agent/kitchen-nav-reorg` or `gh pr view --json url,number,state`, and `pnpm run deploy`. In the native worktree run `git push -u origin agent/kitchen-nav-reorg` and `gh pr create --fill --base main --head agent/kitchen-nav-reorg` or `gh pr view --json url,number,state`. If a command fails because auth/remote/Cloudflare/GitHub credentials are unavailable, save exact output and classify it as a true credential/capability blocker; ordinary CI/build/test failures go back to Unit 6b.
**Output**: Push logs, PR URLs/IDs, deploy logs or blocker notes under `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-6f/`.
**Acceptance**: Branches are pushed and PR/deploy status is recorded; any unavailable external operation is classified as a true credential/capability blocker with exact command/output.

### ⬜ Unit 6g: QA Cleanup And Slugger Notification
**What**: In the web worktree run `pnpm cleanup:qa`; inspect native artifacts for generated disposable data references; notify Slugger with `ouro msg --to slugger "Done: shipped kitchen navigation reorg across web and native surfaces"` after implementation/shipping status is recorded.
**Output**: QA cleanup logs and Slugger notification output under `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/unit-6g/`.
**Acceptance**: Cleanup checks report no Codex-created residue or document any true blockers; Slugger notification succeeds.

## Execution
- **TDD strictly enforced**: tests → red → implement → green → refactor
- Commit after each phase (1a, 1b, 1c)
- Push after each unit complete
- Run full test suite before marking unit done
- For UI/rendering/layout units, run `visual-qa-dogfood` before declaring the unit or task complete
- **All artifacts**: Save outputs, logs, data to `./2026-07-13-1405-doing-kitchen-nav-reorg/` directory
- **Fixes/blockers**: Spawn sub-agent immediately — don't ask, just do it
- **Decisions made**: Update docs immediately, commit right away
