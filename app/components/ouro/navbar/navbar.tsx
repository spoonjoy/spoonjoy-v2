 * The bar across the top of an app: your brand, the main links and a few controls, with
 * the current page marked `aria-current="page"`, and the link of the section it is in `aria-current="true"`, both underlined in the primary colour as in `FamilyBar`, distinct from hover and press highlights. A group of links (`{ label, links }`)
 * opens a panel, as in `NavigationMenu`. Whenever the links do not fit, below 640px and on
 * a narrow tablet, they collapse behind a menu button into a `Sheet` that slides in from
 * the side, with each group under its name; the brand and `actions` stay in the bar. Links
 * render through `OuroProvider`'s `linkComponent`, so your router navigates.
 *
 * The phone menu opens once JavaScript has loaded (after hydration); the links are in the
 * server HTML from 640px up. A tap on the menu button before then does nothing unless your app
 * keeps it: this site's head script keeps a tap on any control React has not yet hydrated, shows
 * the control pressed, and presses it again once it has (`site/src/early-input.ts` in the
 * repository). Once the menu button shows, the sheet is built while the page is idle and kept,
 * hidden, between opens, so a press only shows it.
 *
 * Use `Sidebar` instead for more than a handful of destinations, or sections of them. Use
 * `NavigationMenu` alone for a row of panels inside a page, and `Tabs` for views of one
 * page. `StackedLayout` puts a Navbar above the page.
