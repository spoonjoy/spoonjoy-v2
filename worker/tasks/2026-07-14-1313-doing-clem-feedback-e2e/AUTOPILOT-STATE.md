# Autopilot State: Clem Feedback E2E

## Exit Condition

- Re-audited planning and doing docs converge through every Work Planner reviewer gate.
- Work Doer completes all TDD units with 100% new-code coverage and zero warnings.
- Changed UI passes visual QA on desktop and mobile.
- QA deploy, cross-device smoke, purge, and residue inspection pass before merge.
- A reviewed PR merges with green CI.
- The exact merge SHA's automatic production deploy passes readiness, web/API/cross-device smoke, and cleanup.
- Desk/git/worktree state is terminal and clean; the post-completion Slugger handoff is attempted and any failure reported.

## Current Item

- Repository: `/Users/arimendelow/Projects/spoonjoy-v2-clem-feedback`
- Branch: `worker/clem-feedback-e2e`; current contract checkpoint `1d496687` integrates `origin/main@1bea760ba0c8f10b997f0ca5352880050c30c683`. All prior clean passes are historical because Quality Rounds 27-41 changed release process/recovery semantics.
- Planning: `../2026-07-14-1313-planning-clem-feedback-e2e.md` is `NEEDS_REVIEW` after the mandatory main-drift audit.
- Doing: `../2026-07-14-1313-doing-clem-feedback-e2e.md` is `drafting`; implementation and dependency setup have not started.
- Active gate: fresh Quality Round 42 on immutable contract checkpoint `1d496687`, followed by fresh Tinfoil and Stranger only after Quality converges without contract changes. Round 41's process reviewer converged; schema and terminal/archive found an omitted zero-process CLI vector and loss of the accepted repair-index commit after attempt removal. Both are now retained, exact Unit29.2/Unit37 contracts. Desk remains `processing` with `planning_complete:true` during this post-start planner detour.
- No PR, QA deploy, merge, or production deploy exists yet.

## Next Action

Synchronize checkpoint `1d496687` into Desk, run fresh Quality Round 42 plus consecutive Tinfoil and Stranger reviews, commit/push the final handoff, then restart Unit0a from its fetch/mirror verification.

## Operator-Locked Rules

- Authenticated live cook state is Durable Object-canonical; D1 is private projection/history only.
- Anonymous cook state remains local-only; authenticated local cache/queue is non-canonical.
- No first-party import UI, AI tag-suggestion surface, Pebble-specific behavior, automatic RecipeSpoon creation, or broad navigation redesign.
- SavedRecipe is private and separate from cookbooks; accepted manual tags ship before any AI proposal model.
- Use strict TDD, 100% new-code coverage, zero warnings, atomic commits/pushes, harsh reviewer gates, QA-before-merge, and exact-SHA production verification.
- Stop only for a true human-only credential/capability blocker or an unsafe destructive production action with no staged path.

## Terminal Evidence

- Not terminal. No implementation, CI, deploy, merge, smoke, or cleanup claim has been made.

## Continuation Scan

| candidate | classification | evidence | disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planning reviewer gate | active | Quality Round 41's two release gaps are fixed at immutable contract `1d496687`; process converged only at the superseded input | Run fresh Quality Round 42 and scrutiny convergence |
| Doing review chain | active | Spawn generations, provenance ownership, successor/predecessor closure, track linearization, archive validation, and terminal receipts are executable and fully assigned | Re-converge and restore final handoff |
| Work Doer Units 0-37 | deferred by gate | Full red/green/verify/visual/ship queue is defined | Restart Unit0a only after fresh final handoff |
| PR/QA/merge/production | ready | Units 32-37 define exact-SHA delivery path | Execute after implementation/local validation |

## Recovery Instructions

1. Read this file, the feedback source, planning doc, and doing doc.
2. Run `git status --short --branch` and `git log -5 --oneline` in the worktree.
3. Run `gh pr list --repo spoonjoy/spoonjoy-v2 --state open` and inspect current CI/deploy state.
4. Resume the first non-terminal unit or reviewer gate; update this file after every meaningful checkpoint.

## Stop Condition

Not satisfied. The reopened reviewer gate and all delivery work remain.
