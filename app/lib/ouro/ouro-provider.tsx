   * asks for less.
   * Ouro UI's motion in script reads it, as does `useReducedMotion` for your own: it is in
   * `lib/ouro/use-reduced-motion`, which you can add by name, `lib-use-reduced-motion`. A provider

   * the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query: `[data-motion="reduced"] .wave { animation: none }`.

   * and your own, end at once everywhere but inside a provider set to `full`. It does this with a
   * `<style>` of its own, the one stylesheet an Ouro UI component brings: an app's own setting must
   * still the dialogs, sheets and toasts that render outside the provider's element too, and Ouro
   * UI's classes follow only the device's media query. With `full`, a transition Ouro UI keeps
   * for `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference` still follows the device.

/**
 * Optional app-level provider that routes internal `href`s through your
 * router's link and groups tooltips: once one `Tooltip` shows, its neighbours open
 * instantly instead of each waiting its own delay. Ouro UI components work without it: they honor reduced motion
 * themselves, in CSS (`motion-reduce:` variants and `prefers-reduced-motion`
 * queries), and need no animation library. If your app animates with Motion,
 * wrap it in `<MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">` for the same behavior.
 *
 * An app with a motion setting of its own passes it as `motion`: `<OuroProvider
 * motion={still ? "reduced" : "system"}>`. Its springs, scrolls and moving pictures then
 * follow the app's setting, and your components can too, through `useReducedMotion()`.
 *
 * It installs with every component that renders links (`Button`, `Link`, `Card`, `Item`,
 * `Table` and the navigation components) and with `Tooltip`. An app with none of those adds
 * it by name, `lib-ouro-provider`, at the release tag of your other components (the
 * README's Next.js steps show the command).
 * Type a custom adapter with `ComponentProps<OuroLinkComponent>` so it always
 * compiles, including under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.
 *
 * Every Ouro UI link takes `href`: `Link`, `Button`, `Card`, `Item` and `Table` rows. An
 * internal `href` (a path) renders through `linkComponent`; an absolute URL (`https:`,
 * `mailto:`) always renders a plain `<a>`. Without a provider, or without `linkComponent`,
 * internal links are plain `<a>` elements too, so they work but load the page.
 *
 * React Router's `Link` takes `to`, so it needs the adapter in the example, which maps
 * `href` to `to`. Wrap the app once, in the root route.
 *
 * In Next.js, `next/link`'s `Link` takes `href` and needs no adapter, but a Server
 * Component can't pass `Link`, a function, to a client component: render the provider from
 * a client file, `app/providers.tsx` in the example, and wrap the app in it from
 * `app/layout.tsx`, which stays a Server Component.
